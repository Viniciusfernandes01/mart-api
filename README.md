## Introducion

- The purpose of this project is to show a simple .net core application, but using a current architecture with good practices, reducing the coupling and delimiting the scope.

## Version
- SDK .net core: 3.1

## Packages
- AutoMapper: v9.0.0
- EF Core: v3.1.0
- EF Core InMemory: v3.1.0
- DependencyInjection: v3.1.0
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore: v5.4.1

## Database
In this project I used a database in memory, in the next I will use a relational and non-relational database.
I needed to make some adjustments to program.cs in order to use the EF InMemory package
